    "## 1. The airports data\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this exercise, you will need to retrieve data from airports using 2 APIs. The first API will provide a random list airports (keep of 50 of them randomly), while the second API will provide detailed information about the airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is twofold. Firstly, you need to make a basic POST request with authentication to the application. Secondly, you will learn how to read and apply the documentation of an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: 1st API\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these calls, you will need to authenticate your requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint to use is https://api.oan.one/assembler/etl/ej1\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the calls, you will need to include the `oanToken` header with the token value `ZF7xNEuLAZ5DKLQAEGVUq6VquGLQdsL7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder:** in the digital world, a token can be thought of as a digital \"key\" that allows access to specific services or resources within a system; e.g an API. It serves as a form of authentication, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access protected information or perform certain actions. Think of it as a special passcode that you use to unlock specific features or gain entry to restricted areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP**: Did you try entering the URL in a browser? Before executing the Python code, you can practice making the POST requests in Postman with the corresponding `oanToken`. Then proceed to create the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you make the request, you will receive a JSON object containing a list of airports. You will need to perform a search in part 2 for each airport in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The API will provide you with the IATA codes of the airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the list, randomly select 50 IATA codes of the airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: 2nd API\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed with the exercise, you will need to create an account at https://www.air-port-codes.com/ and obtain the API keys. Once you have the API keys, you can use Postman to explore the available endpoints and determine which one best suits your needs for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dataframe containing the following fields for your 50 random airports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ID (IATA code): int\n",
    "- Name: str\n",
    "- Latitude: float (round to 2 digits)\n",
    "- Longitude: float (round to 2 digits)\n",
    "- Country: str\n",
    "- City: str\n",
    "- Continent: str\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP**: To learn how to use the API, refer to the documentation on the website and try out the endpoints using Postman."
