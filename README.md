# ETL-Episode_II

This repository contains notebooks and resources related to data extraction in an ETL processes. 

Below is a brief overview of the contents:


## Notebooks

1-Data_Extraction.ipynb: This notebook guides you through the process of data extraction from various sources using different techniques. This notebook is to follow the LiveCoding session titled "ETL_Episode_II_Part_I.mp4".

2-Data_Extraction_Scrapping.ipynb: In this notebook, you will learn how to perform data extraction through web scraping, specifically focusing on extracting data from HTML pages. This notebook is to follow the LiveCoding session titled "ETL_Episode_II_Part_II.mp4".

3-Exercises.ipynb: This notebook provides a set of exercises to practice and reinforce the concepts covered in the previous notebooks.

**Observation:** For the LiveCodings, to inspect a page you can right click and click inspect, or press F12.


## Folders

- Images: This folder contains images used in the notebooks for visualizations or illustrations.

- Sources: Here, you can place the source files such as CSV, TXT, XLSX, DOCX, etc., which will be used for data extraction.


## Setting Up the Workspace

To get started, follow the instructions below:

1- Create a folder called "Entorno" (or any other name of your choice) to set up your workspace.

2- Inside the "Entorno" folder, create the following subfolders:

    - "raw": This folder will contain the main notebook file for the LiveCoding sessions.
    - "sources": Place the source files in this folder.
    - "std": This folder is intended for storing standardized data.
    - "trusted": This folder is for storing trusted and validated data.

**Note:** Before starting the LiveCoding session, ensure that you have correctly placed the required source files in the appropriate "Entorno" folder.


Feel free to explore the notebooks, modify the code, and use the provided resources to learn and practice ETL techniques.
